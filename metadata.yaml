      Version 2.1 - Cookie Domain Scope Option
      
      NEW FEATURES:
      - Added Cookie Domain Scope dropdown in Advanced Settings
      - Option 1: "Current domain only" (default) - cookies work on single domain
      - Option 2: "Include all subdomains" - cookies shared across all subdomains
      
      This allows sites with multiple subdomains to share consent preferences
      across their entire domain without requiring users to consent multiple times.
